## Work Packages

1. **Data Acquisition**
   - Download datasets for unemployment and education levels.
   - Verify the structure and format of each dataset.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Standardize data formats (e.g., state names/abbreviations).
   - Handle missing or null values appropriately.

3. **Data Integration**
   - Merge unemployment and education datasets using state identifiers.
   - Ensure the final dataset is ready for analysis.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyze distributions of unemployment rates and education levels.
   - Visualize individual variables using histograms or bar plots.

5. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Compute the correlation coefficient (e.g., Pearson correlation) between unemployment rates and education levels.
   - Perform a significance test to evaluate the strength of the correlation.

6. **Data Visualization**
   - Create a scatter plot with a regression line to depict the relationship.
   - Highlight any significant outliers or patterns.

6. **Report Findings**
   - Document insights in a Markdown file, including visualizations and interpretations.
   - Summarize the methodology, results, and key conclusions.
