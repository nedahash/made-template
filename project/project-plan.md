## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
The Impact of Weather on Migration Patterns Across U.S. States

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
 #### Does weather conditions, such as temperature and precipitation, influence migration patterns and state selection among U.S. residents?

## Description

This project seeks to understand the influence of weather conditions on migration trends across the United States. With changing climate conditions and varying state climates, weather factors may play a significant role in where people choose to relocate. By analyzing state-to-state migration data alongside climate data, this project will explore whether temperature and precipitation levels correlate with migration patterns and, if so, to what extent. The insights from this study could provide valuable information for state policymakers, urban planners, and businesses seeking to understand migration motivations related to climate. Using Python, this analysis will combine historical migration and climate data to examine potential correlations, trends, and significant predictors in migration patterns.


## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

## Datasource1: U.S. Census Bureau Migration Data

* Metadata URL:[U.S. Census Bureau Migration Data](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/geographic-mobility/state-to-state-migration.html)

* Data URL: Direct Link to Migration Data

* Data Type: CSV

* Description: This dataset includes annual state-to-state migration flows, capturing the movement of people between states. It details both inbound and outbound migration counts, allowing analysis of which states are experiencing population gains or losses. The dataset is under public domain (U.S. government data), permitting unrestricted use.


## Datasource2: NOAA Climate Data
* Metadata URL: [NOAA Climate Data](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/)


* Data URL: Direct Link to Climate Data


* Data Type: CSV


* Description: NOAA provides historical climate data, including average temperature and precipitation levels for each state. These metrics will enable the study of how climate conditions vary across states and help determine if certain climates attract or repel residents. The data is covered by the Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL), allowing for free use with attribution.
## Work Packages

<!-- List of work packages ordered sequentially, each pointing to an issue with more details. -->

1. Data Acquisition: Download and organize the migration and climate datasets.


2. Data Cleaning and Preparation: Clean and standardize data formats, ensuring consistency between state identifiers and measurement units across datasets.


3. Data Merging: Merge migration and climate datasets based on state identifiers to create a unified dataset for analysis.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis: Conduct exploratory analyses on migration trends and weather data across states.

5. Correlation Analysis: Analyze the correlation between climate factors (temperature, precipitation) and migration patterns.

6. Data Visualization: Create visualizations to illustrate relationships between migration patterns and weather conditions.

7. Interpretation of Results: Summarize key findings and interpret the potential impact of climate on migration trends.

8. Report Findings: Compile a report outlining the methodology, analysis, and conclusions, providing insights into how weather influences migration patterns.
