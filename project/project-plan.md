# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
The Impact of Temperature on Real Estate Prices Across U.S. States

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
 #### Does the temperature of a state influence real estate prices?

## Description

This project seeks to understand the influence of temperature on real estate prices across the United States. With changing climate conditions, temperature variations may be a key factor affecting property desirability and values. By analyzing state-level real estate price data alongside temperature data, this project will explore whether higher or lower temperatures correlate with property values and how significant this influence may be.

## Work Packages

<!-- List of work packages ordered sequentially, each pointing to an issue with more details. -->

1. Data Acquisition: Download and organize the migration and climate datasets.


2. Data Cleaning and Preparation: Clean and standardize data formats, ensuring consistency between state identifiers and measurement units across datasets.


3. Data Merging: Merge migration and climate datasets based on state identifiers to create a unified dataset for analysis.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis: Conduct exploratory analyses on migration trends and weather data across states.

5. Correlation Analysis: Analyze the correlation between climate factors (temperature, precipitation) and migration patterns.

6. Data Visualization: Create visualizations to illustrate relationships between migration patterns and weather conditions.

7. Interpretation of Results: Summarize key findings and interpret the potential impact of climate on migration trends.

8. Report Findings: Compile a report outlining the methodology, analysis, and conclusions, providing insights into how weather influences migration patterns.
